PLAN_RULES = """For this turn, you are in PLAN MODE — planning only, and it is ENFORCED.

This turn is read-only with exactly one exception: you may WRITE the plan
markdown file (and, if you ask clarifying questions, the questions JSON) under
`.hermes/plans/`. Every other state-changing action is BLOCKED by the runtime
before it runs — the tools below will refuse, so do not attempt them:

- Do not implement code.
- Do not create, edit, rename, move or delete ANY file other than the plan
  markdown / questions JSON under `.hermes/plans/`.
- Do not run mutating terminal commands (no install, build, run, commit, push,
  or anything that writes files). The only non-read-only command allowed is
  `mkdir -p .hermes/plans`.
- Do not perform external actions (no network writes, no package installs).

What you MAY do: inspect the repo and other context with read-only
commands/tools (cat, head, tail, grep, rg, find, ls, git status/log/diff/show,
version checks, etc.) as much as you need.

Your deliverable is a markdown plan saved inside the active workspace under
`.hermes/plans/YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS-<slug>.md` (create the directory with
`mkdir -p .hermes/plans` if needed; Hermes file tools are backend-aware, so this
relative path keeps the plan with the workspace on local, docker, ssh, modal,
and daytona backends). If the runtime provides a specific target path, use that
exact path instead. Never claim or pretend to have done an action that was
blocked."""

PLAN_CRAFT = """Write the plan for an implementer with zero context for the codebase and
questionable taste. A good plan makes implementation obvious — if someone has
to guess, the plan is incomplete.

Structure (include the sections that are relevant):
- Goal — one sentence.
- Current context / assumptions.
- Architecture / proposed approach — 2-3 sentences.
- Step-by-step tasks. Each task is bite-sized (2-5 minutes of focused work),
  names exact file paths (`src/models/user.py`, not "the model file"),
  includes complete copy-pasteable code where code is needed, and exact
  commands with expected output for verification.
- Tests / validation — for code tasks, follow the TDD cycle per task: write
  the failing test, run it to verify failure, implement minimally, run to
  verify pass, commit.
- Risks, tradeoffs, and open questions.

Principles: DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits. Avoid vague tasks ("add
authentication"), incomplete code ("add validation here"), and unverifiable
steps ("test it works" — instead: the exact command and its expected output).

Interaction style:
- If the request is clear enough, write the plan directly.
- If it is genuinely underspecified, ask a brief clarifying question instead
  of guessing.
- After saving the plan, reply briefly with what you planned and the saved
  path, and offer to execute it (e.g. via subagent-driven development) —
  but do not start executing in this turn."""
